# Repo CLI

> [!NOTE]
> Inspired by the GitHub CLI.

The `repo` CLI project is a management tool for git repositories. I use the term **_Git Repository Account Multiplexer_** (GRAM). This is my own term for a repository manager that integrates tools and utilities over existing tools with added configuration, features, and improvemnts to the way repositories are managed using the CLI.
